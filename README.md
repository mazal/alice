## The background for the book
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, handwritten edition
Last page of the 1864 handwritten edition, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland , which was a Christmas present from the author to Alice Liddell. Carroll's photograph of Alice is mounted. This handwritten edition was later published in facsimile in 1886. The book ends with the elder sister reflecting that Alice "sometime in the future would grow up, and that, through all the years of her maturation, she would retain the simple and loving heart she had as a child" (from Arne Ruste's translation).

The first version of the story was performed during a rowboat picnic on July 4, 1862. Carroll and his friend Robinson Duckworth took the three daughters of Dean Henry Liddell with them on the outing. The middle of the three was Alice Liddell (1852–1934), later married Hargreaves.

At Alice's urging, Carroll later developed the story and wrote it down. She received a handwritten version as a Christmas present in 1864, and the finished book was published to the public on 4 July 1865, three years after the boat trip.

There was little in the children's literature of the time that can be seen as precursors to Alice. The main trend was religious and morally didactic children's books, which intended to teach and shape both the readers and the main characters. However, there are exceptions. Charles Dickens' novels have many examples of children at the mercy of living with brutal, strange or unreasonable adults, such as David Copperfield (1850). Ludvig Holberg's Niels Klim's Subterranean Journey was published in English in 1845, and Jules Verne's A Journey to Earth's Interior was published in 1864. At the same time, Charles Kingsley's The Water Babies (1863) was also published, which mixes satire, moral education and a fantasy -like journey of transformation.
